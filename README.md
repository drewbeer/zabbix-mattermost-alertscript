Zabbix Mattermost Alert Script in perl
========================

About
-----
The perl script is the newer version, it handles attachments and larger text. Please make sure you minfy your json before you put it in zabbix.


#### Versions
i dunno, only tested with 3.4, but should work on anything newer as long as you can pass all the vars

#### Huge thanks and appreciation to:
* To everyone that this was sort of based on
* [Allan Graham](https://github.com/muokata) after a million googles was the i started from. (https://github.com/muokata/zabbix-mattermost-alertscript)

Installation
------------

### The script itself

install the JSON perl module

```
cpanm JSON Data::Dumper

```

copy the perl script mattermost.pl to your alert scripts directory

```
	[root@zabbix ~]# grep AlertScriptsPath /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
	### Option: AlertScriptsPath
	AlertScriptsPath=/var/lib/zabbix/alertscripts

	[root@zabbix ~]# ls -lh /var/lib/zabbix/alertscriptsmattermost.sh
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1.6K Nov 19 20:04 /var/lib/zabbix/alertscripts/mattermost.pl

```

Configuration
-------------

### mattermost web-hook

An incoming web-hook integration must be created within your Mattermost account which can be done at https://<your mattermost uri>/chattr/integrations/incoming_webhooks:


the incoming web-hook URL would be something like:

	https://<your mattermost uri>/hooks/ere5h9gfbbbk8gdxsdsduwuicsd

save it, you'll need it in a second.


### Within the Zabbix web interface

When logged in to the Zabbix servers web interface with super-administrator privileges, navigate to the "Administration" tab, access the "Media Types" sub-tab, and click the "Create media type" button.

You need to create a media type as follows:

* **Name**: Mattermost
* **Type**: Script
* **Script name**: mattermost.pl

add the following script parameters (you can use my image, but all are required right now)

```
https://drew.beer/images/bots/monitorBot.jpg
```

* `{ALERT.SENDTO}`
* `http://webhook.url.from.above/oranges`
* `bots name here`
* `http://img.icon.of.bot.here`
* `{ALERT.MESSAGE}`


create a user like zabbixBot, and set media then add choose the new script, and the channel you want it to go to like #alerts or @someone.


then setup the action in configurations, and then custom messages for both triggers and resolve.

i used json because its less work that way, i can pass any data back and forth really.

```
{"fallback":"fw1.fr.domain.com:Average Usage over 5sec per Processor#1 exceeded 80%:PROBLEM","pretext":"High","text":"","author_name":"fw1.fr.domain.com","title":"Average Usage over 5sec per Processor#1 exceeded 80%","title_link":"https://zabbix.yourdomain.com/tr_events.php?triggerid=14165&eventid=2796868","fields":[{"short":true,"title":"Status","value":"PROBLEM"},{"title":"Time","value":"2018.01.01 22:30:18","short":true}]}
```

you'll notice its json minified, the examples are in this repo, you can just follow mattermosts examples for attachments.

just make sure you minify otherwise it will break in a bad way.


Testing
-------
try this as an examples

```

./mattermost.pl monitoring https://your.webhook/url zabbix https://drew.beer/images/bots/monitorBot.jpg '{
    "fallback": "{HOST.NAME}:{TRIGGER.NAME}:{STATUS}",
    "pretext": "{TRIGGER.SEVERITY}",
    "text": "{TRIGGER.DESCRIPTION}",
    "author_name": "{HOST.NAME}",
    "title": "{TRIGGER.NAME}",
    "title_link": "https://zabbix.domain.com/tr_events.php?triggerid={TRIGGER.ID}&eventid={EVENT.ID}",
    "fields": [
      {
        "short": true,
        "title":"Status",
        "value":"{STATUS}"
      },
      {
        "title": "Time",
        "value": "{EVENT.DATE} {EVENT.TIME}",
        "short": true
      }
    ]
  }'

```

you can always enable debug $debug = 1; and you should get what you need out of it defaults to /tmp/zabbix-mattermost.log

good luck
